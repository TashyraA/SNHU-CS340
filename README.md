## Project Two: Grazioso Salvare Dashboard Reflection

## Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs

When I write programs, I focus on creating code that is clear, organized, and easy to update in the future. For example, in Project One, I developed a CRUD Python module to handle database operations for the animal shelter. This module abstracts the complexity of interacting with MongoDB, so any code that needs to read, create, update, or delete records can do so without directly managing connections or queries. Using this approach in Project Two allowed me to quickly connect the dashboard widgets to the database and filter the data dynamically. The advantage of this modular approach is that it keeps my code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and makes it reusable: in the future, I could use the same CRUD module for other applications, dashboards, or reports involving animal data, without rewriting the database logic from scratch.

## Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist

When I approached the requirements from Grazioso Salvare, I started by breaking the project into smaller tasks: first ensuring the database could be accessed, then creating the interactive dashboard components, and finally linking everything together. I relied heavily on planning the user experience, thinking about how a client would want to filter and view data, and making sure the interface was intuitive. This approach was more structured than previous assignments because it involved multiple layers—database design, backend logic, and frontend presentation. In future projects, I would continue using this strategy: carefully planning queries and modular code before implementing, using filtering and aggregation to answer client questions efficiently, and building reusable components for the database or frontend.

## What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters

Computer scientists design, build, and maintain systems that allow organizations to operate efficiently and make data-driven decisions. In this project, my work on the animal shelter dashboard demonstrates exactly that: by creating a tool that visualizes outcomes, shows geolocation maps, and allows interactive filtering, I helped create a system where Grazioso Salvare staff can quickly understand their animal rescue data. Projects like this matter because they turn raw data into actionable insights, improve decision-making, and save time—ultimately helping companies serve their mission more effectively.
